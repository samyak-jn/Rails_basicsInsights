             component of web application:
                    like
                    restraunt ->customerno link to rails application(kitchen)
                    you need a server who bascially gets the request from you and give it back to you

                    fb menu : friends sharing
                    to run the server we need to navigate to an application
                    ls
                    cd test_app
                    //locally rails server
                    //on nitrous rails server -b 0.0.0.0
                    we need a production version to start huruku for producton starting making our application available


                    developer : here are all development ,fake 
                    production: all real info ,all consequences 
                    
        server : webrick (default)
        to shut down of the server
rails server :  eails server -b 0.0.,0.0
            we are building it using a router :
